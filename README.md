# Sentence_Similarity_STSBenchmark

My Sentence Similarity Project is focused on the popular STS (Semantic Textual Similarity) benchmark dataset, employing the "sentence transformer" model - "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" for the task. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were applied for preprocessing the text data. 
To measure the similarity between sentence pairs, cosine similarity was utilized. For evaluating the model's performance, Pearson's Correlation and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used as the metrics. These evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's ability to capture semantic similarity between sentences and quantify its performance in comparison to human-generated similarity scores in the STS benchmark dataset.
